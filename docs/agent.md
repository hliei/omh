# In-process Agent

`omh.agent.Agent` is a stateful, in-process agent that runs model conversations without a Session, Branch, or AgentLane. Persistent execution stays in the experimental durable harness ([`omh.agent.durable`](harness.md)); the two paths use separate execution cores.

## Creating an Agent

The Agent requires an explicit `StreamFn` and model; nothing binds a provider implicitly:

```python
from omh.agent import Agent, AgentInitialState, AgentOptions

agent = Agent(
    AgentOptions(
        stream_fn=my_stream_fn,
        initial_state=AgentInitialState(
            system_prompt="You are concise.",
            model=my_model,
            messages=[],          # optional seed transcript
            tools=[],             # executable tool declarations
            thinking_level="off",
        ),
    )
)
```

`initial_state.system_prompt` and `initial_state.tools` seed a leading `SystemMessage` unless `initial_state.messages` already starts with one. `StreamFn` receives a normalized `TranscriptContext`: the prompt and tool declarations are carried by system messages, not by a separate field.

## State and ownership

`Agent.state` exposes:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `messages` | Transcript. Assigning copies the top-level list; message objects are shared, not deep-copied. |
| `tools` | Executable tool declarations. Assigning copies the top-level list. |
| `system_prompt` | Read-only prompt replayed from the transcript's system messages. |
| `model`, `thinking_level` | Configuration for future turns. |
| `is_streaming` | True from run start until terminal listeners settle. |
| `streaming_message` | Current partial assistant message, if any. |
| `error_message` | Error text from the most recent failed or aborted turn. |

The Agent passes the loop an independent context snapshot; mutating the snapshot during a run does not mutate `Agent.state.messages`.

## Running and continuing

`await agent.prompt(text, images=None)` accepts text, a single message, or a message batch. `await agent.continue_()` continues from an existing transcript whose last message is a user or tool-result message; it rejects empty or system-only history and an assistant tail. A busy Agent rejects `prompt`, `continue_`, and `reset`. `reset()` clears the conversation and run state while retaining the replayed system baseline.

## Events and subscribers

`agent.subscribe(listener)` registers a listener and returns an unsubscribe function. After each event the Agent updates public state, then awaits listeners in subscription order. `agent_end` is the final event, but `agent.is_streaming` stays true and `wait_for_idle()` stays pending until its listeners settle.

The conversation lifecycle emits `agent_start`, `turn_start`, `message_start`, `message_update`, `message_end`, `turn_end`, and `agent_end`. Assistant stream deltas arrive as `message_update` with the provider event attached.

## Cancellation

The Agent owns its run. Cancelling a caller awaiting `prompt`, `continue_`, or `wait_for_idle` ends only that wait; the run and other waiters continue. `agent.abort()` cooperatively signals the current run, and the Agent becomes idle only after the run and its terminal listeners settle. Abort does not preempt uncooperative work or undo side effects.

## Not yet delivered

Tools execution, input queues, request/turn hooks, custom message conversion, and provider integration are planned in later slices. This document describes the delivered conversation path only.
